/*There is an array that takes in values
A loop runs through the array and picks out each element
It sums the remaining elements in the array and creates another array where the
sums are saved
This is the same for the other elements. They are ignored in the array while
the other elements are summed
These sums are saved in the new array.
After the first array has been completely looped through, the maximum and minimum
of the new array is found
